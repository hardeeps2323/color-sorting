# color-sorting
The Color Sorting System is an innovative project designed to automate the process of sorting objects based on their colors. This system utilizes an Arduino microcontroller along with a color sensor to detect and differentiate colors accurately. The primary goal is to identify objects of various colors and sort them accordingly, which can be highly beneficial in industries like recycling, manufacturing, and packaging. By integrating simple hardware components with efficient coding, the project demonstrates how automation can improve efficiency and reduce manual labor in sorting tasks.
